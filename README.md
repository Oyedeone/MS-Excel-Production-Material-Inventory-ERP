# MS-Excel-Production-Material-Inventory-ERP
A mini ERP system for managing the movement of production materials from suppliers and across four different stores has been developed using Microsoft Excel and VBA. This system aims to minimize delays encountered during monthly stock-taking and alignment processes. Additionally, it facilitates the tracking of material movement between the stores.
